<ul>Hello, I'm Riley :)</ul>
<ul>I study computers and do machine learning research at UC Berkeley. I plan to continue working on interesting projects during my time as an undergraduate, then pursue an MBA or a PhD in artificial intelligence.</ul>
<ul>I live in Chicago, but grew up in Lucca, Italy. In my free time, I like to explore nature, spend quality time with friends, and read psychology.</ul>
<ul>Email at <a href="mailto:rileyedmunds@berkeley.edu">rileyedmunds@github.com</a>, read my code on <a href="http://github.com/rileyedmunds">GitHub</a>, and find my professional background on <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/rileyedmunds">LinkedIn</a>.</ul>
