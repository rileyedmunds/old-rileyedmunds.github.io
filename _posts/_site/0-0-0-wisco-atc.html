<p>This semester, I’ve been helping my friend Sam work on a trading platform with a club he founded at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p>

<p>We’re writing code to automate trading in the FOREX market. A couple things we’ve done:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hosted our package so it works real-time, around the clock</li>
  <li>Writen code to pull in and parse market data</li>
  <li>Written code that runs benchmark macro analysis market indicators on the market data</li>
  <li>Integrated our indicator outputs with the trading platform API to execute trades based on our analysis</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h3>
<p>A couple things we’re working on in the next couple months:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pass indicators of the state of the market to a classifiers trained on when it’s most beneficial to consult a particular market indicator</li>
  <li>Pass the outputs from various indicators as features to a simple network trained on their respective results and the market outcome</li>
  <li>Code up a more complex LSTM in tensorflow and throw it at the market indicator feature set.</li>
</ol>
