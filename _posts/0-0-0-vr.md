In spring 2016, I joined [Virtual Reality at Berkeley (VR@B)](https://vr.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}, an organization that specializes in developing and researching Augmented and Virtual Reality.


The first semester I was involved with VR@B, I worked as a 3D artist designing a model for the UC Berkeley Campanile carillon as part of the ![VR@B Virtual Campanile project]
  

*"Last semester, using the Unity game engine and the HTC Vive, we created
a virtual version of the Campanile along with an interactive carillon, a
massive musical instrument consisting of 61 bells on top of the tower.
The intent of this project was to provide people the chance to experience
playing a well-known instrument that is rarely accessible on campus. The
Virtual Campanile was very well received on Cal Day 2016"* -Yulin Zheng, Team Lead.

This semester, Fall 2016, I'm working with a team under the supervision of Allen Yang, director of the [Center for Augmented Cognition](http://augcog.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}, on visualizing neural networks in virtual reality.

Our project consists of porting TensorBoard neural network graphs into virtual reality, for ease of understanding and debugging. The final product will demonstrate 3D virtual reality visualization of a simple MNIST convolutional neural network using Unity Game Engine, and be considered as an addition to TensorBoard. 

This is our preliminary idea, based on Adam W. Harley's interactive [visualization](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/)...

In terms of VR/AR in general, I'm most hopeful about the effects that advences in vision will have on the viability of Augmented Reality in the coming years, applied to everything from tensegrity robotics to iPhones.
