In spring 2016, I joined [Virtual Reality at Berkeley (VR@B)](https://vr.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}, an organization that specializes in developing and researching Augmented and Virtual Reality.


The first semester I was involved with VR@B, I worked as a 3D artist designing a model for the UC Berkeley Campanile carillon as part of the ![VR@B Virtual Campanile project]:

This fall, I'm working with Allen Yang, director of the [Center for Augmented Cognition](http://augcog.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} on visualizing neural networks in virtual reality.

Our project consists of porting Tensorboard neural network graphs into 3D, for ease of understanding and debugging. The final product will be an MVP that demonstrates virtual reality visualization of a simple MNIST convolutional neural network using Unity Game Engine.

I'm most hopeful about the effects that advences in vision will have on the viability of Augmented Reality in the coming years, applied to everything from tensegrity robotics to iPhones.
