This winter break, I decided to take some time to make sure I fully understand the implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, and explore a couple new neural network architectures.
 
I searched for a simple overview of neural network architecures, and found a collection called the ['Neural Network Zoo'](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/){:target="_blank"} -- I decided to use this collection as my guide.  

As I worked through the models, I read and studied Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville's new book, [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/){:target="_blank"}.

Here's the challenge I gave myself:  
  
***Implement each and every model from The 'Neural Network Zoo' in TensorFlow over 2016-2017 winter break***

Here's my [code on GitHub](https://github.com/rileyedmunds/zoochallenge){:target="_blank"}, and here are the algorithms I've implemented thus far...
  
  
- Perceptron  
- Vanilla Feed Forward Network    
- Radial Basis Function Network    
- Deep Feed Forward Network       
- Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network   
- Long Short-Term Memory Network  
- Gated Recurrent Unit Network  
- Vanilla Auto Encoder    
- Denoising Auto Encoder   
- Sparse Auto Encoder    
- Markov Chain    
- Boltzmann Machine   
- Restricted Boltzmann Machine   
- Deep Belief Network   
- Deep Convolutional Network   
- Deconvolutional Network   
- Support Vector Machine

I learned a couple things along the way...    
  
1.  Tensorflow isn't perfect. It lacks support for several algorithms. For these outliers, I used Scikit-learn. 
2.  Sticking to the basics is underrated.
  
NOTE: *Some of the Network Zoo's models are outdated, and some popular models are missing. I'll be updating this post as I update my list and implement more models.*
