This winter break, I decided to take some time to make sure I fully understand the implementations of popular algorithms, and explore a couple new neural network architectures.
 
I searched for a simple overview of neural network architecures, and found a collection called the ['Neural Network Zoo'](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/){:target="_blank"} -- I decided to run with it. As I worked through the models, I read and studied Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville's new book, [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/){:target="_blank"}.

Here's the challenge I gave myself: implement each and every model from The 'Neural Network Zoo' in TensorFlow over Winter Break 2016-2017:
 
Perceptron (P)  
Feed Forward (FFN) 
Radial Basis Function (RBF) 
Deep Feed Forward (DFF) 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) 
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
Auto Encoder (AE) 
Variational AE (VAE) 
Denoising AE (DAE) 
Sparse AE (SAE) 
Markov Chain (MC) 
Hopfield Network (HN) 
Boltzmann Machine (BM) 
Restricted BM (RBM) 
Deep Belief Network (DBN) 
Deep Convolutional Network (DCN) 
Deconvolutional Network (DN) 
Deep Comvolutional Inverse Graphics Network (DCIGN) 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) 
Liquid State Machine (LSM) 
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) 
Echo State Network (ESN) 
Deep Residual Network (DRN) 
Kohonen Network (KN) 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Neural Turing Machine (NTM) 
 
 
So far, here's my [code](https://github.com/rileyedmunds/zoochallenge), and here are the algorithms I've implemented so far...
 
 
-Perceptron (P) 
-Feed Forward (FFN) 
-Radial Basis Function (RBF) 
-Deep Feed Forward (DFF) 
-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
-Auto Encoder (AE) 
-Denoising AE (DAE) 
-Sparse AE (SAE) 
-Markov Chain (MC) 
-Boltzmann Machine (BM) 
-Restricted BM (RBM) 
-Deep Belief Network (DBN) 
-Deep Convolutional Network (DCN) 
-Deconvolutional Network (DN) 
-Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
 
  
 
A couple things I learned: 
-Tensorflow isn't perfect. While it's a great framework, and has a growing support community, it lacks support for several algorithms in the Neural Network Zoo -- I had to default to Scikit-learn in these cases.
 
*NOTE* I'll be updating this post as I work through new models. I realized that some of these models are outdated, and some popular models are missing. I will update this page as I update the list.
