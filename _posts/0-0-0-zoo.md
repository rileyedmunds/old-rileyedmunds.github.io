This winter break, I decided to take some time to make sure I fully understand the implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, and explore a couple new neural network architectures.
 
I searched for a simple overview of neural network architecures, and found a collection called the ['Neural Network Zoo'](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/){:target="_blank"} -- I decided to use this collection as my guide.  

As I worked through the models, I read and studied Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville's new book, [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/){:target="_blank"}.
 
Here's the challenge I gave myself:  
***Implement each and every model from The 'Neural Network Zoo' in TensorFlow over Winter Break 2016-2017***
 
Perceptron  
Feed Forward Network  
Radial Basis Function  
Deep Feed Forward  
Recurrent Neural Network  
Long ShortTerm Memory     
Gated Recurrent Unit    
Auto Encoder    
Variational Auto Encoder    
Denoising Auto Encoder  
Sparse Auto Encoder   
Markov Chain  
Hopfield Network

Restricted Boltzmann Machine   
Deep Belief Network    
Deep Convolutional Network

Generative Adversarial Network   
Liquid State Machine

Echo State Network    
Deep Residual Network  
Kohonen Network    
Support Vector Machine   
Neural Turing Machine

Here's my [code](https://github.com/rileyedmunds/zoochallenge){:target="_blank"}, and here are the algorithms I've implemented thus far...
  
  
- Perceptron (P)  
- Feed Forward Network (FFN)  
- Radial Basis Function (RBF)  
- Deep Feed Forward (DFF)  
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
- Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM)  
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  
- Auto Encoder (AE)  
- Denoising AE (DAE)  
- Sparse AE (SAE)  
- Markov Chain (MC)  
- Boltzmann Machine (BM)  
- Restricted BM (RBM)  
- Deep Belief Network (DBN)  
- Deep Convolutional Network (DCN)  
- Deconvolutional Network (DN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  
   
  
A couple things I've' learned:   
-Tensorflow isn't perfect. While it's a great framework, and has a growing support community, it lacks support for several algorithms in the Neural Network Zoo: in these cases, I used Scikit-learn.
  
NOTE: * Some of the Network Zoo's models are outdated, and some popular models are missing. I'll be updating this post as I update my list and implement more models.*
