Hello, I'm Riley :)

I study computer science, applied math, and do machine learning research at UC Berkeley. I plan to continue working on interesting projects during my time as an undergraduate, then pursue an MBA or a PhD in artificial intelligence.

I live in Chicago, but grew up in Lucca, Italy. In my free time, I like to explore nature, spend quality time with friends, and read psychology.

Email me at [edmunds@ml.berkeley.edu](mailto:edmunds@ml.berkeley.edu), read my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/rileyedmunds), and find my professional background on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/rileyedmunds).
