Hello, I'm Riley :)

I study computers and mathematics at UC Berkeley. I'm passionate about data science and do research in machine learning and artificial intelligence on top of being a full-time student.

I live in Chicago, but grew up in Lucca, Italy. In my free time, I like to explore nature, spend quality time with friends, and read psychology.

I plan to continue working on interesting projects during my time as an undergraduate, then pursue an MBA or a PhD in artificial intelligence.

Email me at [edmunds@ml.berkeley.edu](mailto:edmunds@ml.berkeley.edu), read my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/rileyedmunds), find my professional background on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/rileyedmunds), and read about some of my projects in the ['Ideas'](http://rileyedmunds.com/) section.
