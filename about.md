Hello, I'm Riley :)

I study computers and do machine learning research at UC Berkeley. I plan to continue working on interesting projects during my time as an undergraduate, then pursue an MBA or a PhD in artificial intelligence.

I live in Chicago, but grew up in Lucca, Italy. In my free time, I like to explore nature, spend quality time with friends, and read psychology.
